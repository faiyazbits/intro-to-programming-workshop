# Points to be discussed in this section

## Variables ##
* Keywords in programming language
* Primitive datatypes - string,number,boolean, null
* Defining/declarling a variable using let or const. prefer const
* Reassigning a variable declared using let
* what happens in memory when we declare a variable
* Dont start variable names with capital unless it is a constant
* If it is constant then use capital letters for the whole name
* Separate words in varible name using capitalize or underscore
* If the value of the variable is boolean. then name can start with 'is','can','has' 

## Arrays ##
* problem with storing all information in variables
* Need for array/list
* Arrays are ordered by definition
* Zero based indexing
* position matters in array
* Arrays doesnt provide fast lookup as we need to scan many/all     elements


## Objects ##
* Problem with storing all information in arrays or variables
* Need for objects/hasmap/map/dict
* Information stored in key value pairs
* Faster or instant lookup of information
* More readable code
* Two ways of accessing and modifying properties in an object(dot and brackets)
* Dynamically accessing and setting properties using array notation
