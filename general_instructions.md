# some general guidelines for trainees

* Dont try to answer quick. take your time. execute the code in your mind and then answer. we prefer correct answer rather than quick answer

* Asking questions is to promote collective learning not to point fingers

* Feel free to interupt the session and clear the doubts that pop in to your mind then and there itself

* Dont assume. take time to understand and code intentionally

* we will only demonstrate concepts with small set of data. you may need to think in scale to figure out the problems that concept is trying to solve

* whenever a task or program is completed and you got the 
desired output, let the one who gave the task know so that you can get you code reviewed. dont wait to be asked

* If you get stuck and not sure how to proceed , think hard and try for around an hour max . then ask others. our focus should be on quick and deep understanding, so dont waster time pondering
